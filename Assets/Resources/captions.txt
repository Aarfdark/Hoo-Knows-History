Our journey begins not within the bounds of the University, but just beyond them — past the open horizon Jefferson left at the edge of the Academical Village so students would always look outward, beyond the familiar, toward the unknown — toward the future waiting just beyond what they could see. Toward what would soon be known as Kitty Foster’s Canada."

The year is 1820, and a woman named Catherine “Kitty” Foster, a Black woman of light complexion and possibly mixed ancestry, has just gained her freedom. That lighter skin — likely the result of a white father — would have influenced how she was seen and treated, sometimes offering a measure of protection in a society built on racial hierarchy."
